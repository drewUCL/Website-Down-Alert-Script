Website Polling <br>
=============================================

###Introduction
This is designed to run when a site of interest is down and you are wanting to be on it as soon as it is fixed. This recently happened to me when trying to buy NAMECOIN as the site had crashed and I was wanting to buy some as soon as the site went back online (the quicker the better for obvious reasons)
